<h1>Assigment 3 Java Script</h1>

<div>
	<details>
		<summary>1.Name the three ways to declare a variable? </summary>
	<p> Each keyword holds some specific reason or feature in JavaScript. Basically we can declare variables in three different ways by using var, let and const keyword.</p>
		</details>
	<details>
	<summary>2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?</summary>
	<p></p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?</summary>
	<p>
		 <ul>
			<li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
			<li>Names must begin with a letter, not be a digit</li>
			<li>Names can also begin with $ and _ </li>
			<li>Names are case sensitive (a and A are different variables)</li>
			<li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.</li>
			<li>When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. (myVeryLongName)</li>
		 </ul>
	</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and
			strings?</summary>
	<p><ul>
		<li>+ (Addition): </li>
<li>‘+’ operator performs addition on two operands. 
Example: Y = 5 + 5 gives Y = 10</li>
<li>‘+’ operator can also be used to concatenate (add) strings. </li>
	</ul></p></details>	
	<details>
		<summary>5. How does the % operator work?</summary>
		<p>Modulus operator. Returns remainder of two operands.</p>
	</details>	
	<details> 
		<summary>6. Explain the difference between == and ===</summary>
		<p>The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.</p>
		</details>
	<details>
		<summary>7. When would you receive a NaN result?</summary>
	<p>Nan means “Not a number”, represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>8. How do you increment and decrement a number?</summary>
	<p>
		The JavaScript Increment and Decrement Operators useful to increase or decrease the value by 1. For instance, Incremental operator ++ used to increase the existing variable value by 1 (x = x + 1). The decrement operator – – is used to decrease or subtract the existing value by 1 (x = x – 1).</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement
			operators.</summary>
	<p>
		The difference between the two lies in their return values. The prefix increment returns the value of a variable after it has been incremented. On the other hand, the more commonly used postfix increment returns the value of a variable before it has been incremented.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?</summary>
	<p>Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. The multiplication operator (" * ") has higher precedence than the addition operator (" + ") and thus will be evaluated first.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>11. How do you log information to the console?</summary>
	<p>console.log(A);</p></details>	
	<details>
		<summary>12. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?</summary>
	<p>Description. The unary plus ( + ) operator is the fastest (and preferred) method of converting something into a number. It can convert: string representations of integers (decimal or hexadecimal) and floats.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>13. What are the eight data types in JavaScript?</summary>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>String.</li>
      <li>Number.</li>
      <li>Boolean.</li>
      <li>Null.</li>
      <li>Undefined.</li>
      <li>Symbol.</li>
      <li>BigInt.</li>
      <li>Object.</li>
		</ul>
	</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>14. Which data type is NOT primitive?</summary>
	<p>The 'object' is a non-primitive data type in JavaScript.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>15. What is the relationship between null and undefined? </summary>
	<p>Null - "empty" or "nothing"; Underfined - value is not ssigned. </p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>16. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?</summary>
	<p>As you may have understood now, there is no real difference between using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>17. What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?</summary>
	<p>
		String interpolation is replacing placeholders with values in a string literal. The string interpolation in JavaScript is performed by template literals (strings wrapped in backticks ` ) and ${expression} as a placeholder.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>18. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?</summary>
	<p></p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>19. How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?</summary>
	<p>We can use the ${} syntax to insert a variable.11 июл. 2017 г.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>20. How do you escape characters in a string?</summary>
	<p>Javascript uses '\' (backslash) in front as an escape character. To print quotes, using escape characters we have two options: For single quotes: \' (backslash followed by single quote) For double quotes: \” (backslash followed by double quotes)</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>21. What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?</summary>
	<p>These 2 functions are quite similar in their Syntax But are different in some cases.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>22. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?</summary>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>&&</strong> - Logical AND: true if both the operands/boolean values are true, else evaluates to false</li>
		  <li><strong>||</strong> - Logical OR: true if either of the operands/boolean values is true . evaluates to false if both are false</li>
		  <li><strong>!</strong> - Logical NOT: true if the operand is false and vice-versa.</li>
		</ul>
	</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>23.What are the comparison operators?</summary>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>==</strong> - <strong>Equal to:</strong> true if the operands are equal</li>
			<li><strong>!=</strong> - <strong>Not equal to:</strong> true if the operands are not equal</li>
			<li><strong>===</strong> - <strong>Strict equal to:</strong> true if the operands are equal and of the same type</li>
			<li><strong>!==</strong> - <strong>Strict not equal to:</strong>true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all </li>
			<li><strong>></strong> - <strong>Greater than:</strong> true if the left operand is greater than the right operand </li>
			<li><strong>>=</strong> - <strong>Greater than or equal to:</strong>true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand</li>
			<li><strong>/<</strong> - <strong>Less than:</strong> true if the left operand is less than the right operand</li>
			<li><strong>/<=</strong> - <strong>Less than or equal to:</strong> true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand</li>
		</ul>

		<summary>24.What are truthy and falsy values?</summary>
	<p>A trthy and falsy value is a value that is considered true or false when encountered in a Boolean context.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>25.What are the truthy values in JavaScript?</summary>
	<p>In JavaScript, a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>26.What are the falsy values in JavaScript?</summary>
	<p>They evaluate to false when coerced by JavaScript’s typing engine into a boolean value, but they are not necessarily equal to each other.The 7 falsy values are: 0 , 0n , null , undefined , false , NaN , and "".</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>27.What is the syntax for an if/else conditional? </summary>
	<p></p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>28. What is the syntax for a switch statement?</summary>
	<p>The syntax of the switch statement is: statement(s); break; case constant 2: statement(s);</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>29. What is the syntax for a ternary operator?</summary>
	<p>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>30. What is nesting?</summary>
	<p>Nesting is a term used to describe the placement of one or more objects within another object. Writing one function inside another function.</p></details>	<details>
		<summary>31. What are functions useful for?</summary>
	<p>Function allows to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>32. How do you invoke a function?</summary>
	<p>This is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.</p></details>	<details>
		<summary>33. What are anonymous functions?</summary>
	<p>An anonymous function is a function that was declared without any named identifier to refer to it. <strong>Example:</strong> function hello() { alert('Hello world'); } hello();</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>34. What is function scope?</summary>
	<p>JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>35. What are return values?</summary>
	<p>JavaScript passes a value from a function back to the code that called it by using the return statement. The value to be returned is specified in the return. That value can be a constant value, a variable, or a calculation where the result of the calculation is returned.</p></details>	<details>
		<summary>36. What are arrow functions?</summary>
	<p>It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions. For example, This function // function expression let x = function(x, y) { return x * y; }</p></details>
